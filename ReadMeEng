Bull NFT DAPP minting NFT

Hello, Here is an NFT Minting Dapp

Necessary material :

-NODE JS -Truffle -Ganache (for test on ETH test server) -Metamask -Have a server that will keep the JSON and PNG of the nft

Project description :

-Backend: it is the generation of the NFTs as well as their JSON file -Contract: Creation of the token -Frontend: Dapp Minting relation with the metadata (JSON file of the nft) and the BC

Start :

Backend

Run the command: Yarn add all Put in index.js the URL of the server which will keep the NFTs

You must first have the necessary visuals to launch the automatic generation of nft. therefore PNGs to be included in the Input category

Once the images are placed to generate NFTs, all you have to do is change the number you want in the index.js code and type the command: node index.js
This will generate NFTs in the OUTPUT file as well as NFTs in the most important JSON format.

The OUTPUT folder should be placed in our server at the URL indicated above.

Contract

Use of remix

Frontend

yarn add all

First put our code.sol in the SmartContract.sol file

To use Truffle: First start, Ganache to have a key as well as accounts already credited in ETH test to have them, just use Metemask and enter the key given at the top of the ganache client.

Then entered the test RPC given in Ganache to give a new BC on Metamask RPC: HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545 Chain ID 1337

In truflle Config .js

development: {
  host: "127.0.0.1", // Localhost (default: none)
  port: 7545, // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
  network_id: "*", // Any network (default: none)
Then to test

truffle migrate --reset

This will test our contract and create the ABIs in src contract

All you have to do then, unless there is an error, is to run this command and you will have a localhost with an application that opens on the web You must connect with the metamask

yarn start to start the server

There it is, thanks
